### Honors in Undergraduate Research Program
Qualified undergraduates may earn an Honors in Research designation in their transcript. The Honors in Research program gives an undergraduate the opportunity to participate in a research project under the direction of a faculty member. It is expected that the student will be actively involved in research that could lead to new knowledge. The project can be independent or a component of a larger team effort. 
Admission Requirements include: 
  1. Complete at least one semester on the UW-Madison campus, 
  2. Have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.5,
  3. Major in Computer Engineering (CMPE) or Electrical Engineering (EE), 
  4. Identify an ECE faculty advisor who is willing to supervise the research project. 


Students admitted to the program should register for one to three credits of E C E 489 Honors in Research. The “Honors in Research” designation will be awarded to graduates who:
  1. Complete either the CMPE or EE degree requirements.
  2. Have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 at graduation.
  3. Complete a total of at least six credits of E C E 489 Honors in Research.
  4. Receive a final grade of at least B in E C E 489 Honors in Research.

## University Degree Requirements
University General Education Requirements Requirements | Detail  
---|---  
Total Degree | To receive a bachelor's degree from UW–Madison, students must earn a minimum of 120 degree credits. The requirements for some programs may exceed 120 degree credits. Students should consult with their college or department advisor for information on specific credit requirements.  
Residency | Degree candidates are required to earn a minimum of 30 credits in residence at UW–Madison. "In residence" means on the UW–Madison campus with an undergraduate degree classification. “In residence” credit also includes UW–Madison courses offered in distance or online formats and credits earned in UW–Madison Study Abroad/Study Away programs.  
Quality of Work | Undergraduate students must maintain the minimum grade point average specified by the school, college, or academic program to remain in good academic standing. Students whose academic performance drops below these minimum thresholds will be placed on academic probation.
